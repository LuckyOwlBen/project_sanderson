    description: "The Vorin city-state of New Natanan is located near the Ocean of Origins. This meager landholding is a remnant of a much larger empire that was destroyed long ago. The ruins of its capital, once called Stormseat, were reclaimed by the listeners and called Narak. Today, some Natans live as nomads that travel the desolate lands previously contained in their empire. Ethnic Natans have pale blue skin and white hair. They mostly exist in isolation, either as nomads or as citizens confined to New Natanan by vigorous highstorms that make sea travel exceptionally perilous. Their sense of loss over their empire, particularly Stormseat and its Oathgate, persists.",
