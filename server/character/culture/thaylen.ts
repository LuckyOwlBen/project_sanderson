    description: "The island nation of Thaylenah is ruled by a monarch who is elected by merchant councils and naval officers. The nation thrives on international trade by land and sea, and it rewards particularly industrious merchants with increased social status. Although the nation is Vorin, Thaylens are more flexible with their faith and tend to ignore or relax customs rigidly upheld in Jah Keved and Alethkar. Ethnic Thaylens have tan skin and long white eyebrows that can be creatively styled as dictated by fashion trends and personal preferences. Their hair is usually brown or black, but some Thaylens dye their hair in bold colors. They favor tight vests with loose pants and skirts.",
