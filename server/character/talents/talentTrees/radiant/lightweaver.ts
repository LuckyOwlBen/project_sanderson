Spend 1 Investiture or more to use your Illumination surge to infuse a physical illusion in thin air, following the normal rules for either a simple or complex illusion. However, unlike other illusions, this physical illusion occupies its space as if it were real; objects can\'t pass through it, and if it\'s Medium or larger, it can be used as cover. This illusion weighs half as much as the real version would (maximum of 25 pounds per surge rank). Though it isn\'t a character, it has health equal to 5 × your ranks in Transformation, and each of its defenses equals 10 + your Transformation modifier. If the illusion is reduced to 0 health, its infusion ends early and any infused Investiture is lost. When you control your physical illusion, it can interact with its environment (such as an illusionary chicken flying into a windowpane). You can use focus to task one of your physical illusions with something that requires a test (such as attacking someone) or your careful attention (such as writing a note). When the illusion\'s task requires a test, you must be able to sense its target, and you use your Illumination instead of that test\'s usual skill. For example, if the illusion is attacking with a real weapon, test your Illumination but otherwise follow the normal rules for that attack. While wielding an illusionary weapon, the illusion can make a melee attack against the Physical defense of a target within its reach. This attack deals either keen or impact damage depending on the illusionary weapon, and the size of its damage dice increases with your ranks in Transformation: at 2 ranks, roll 2d6 damage; at 3 ranks, roll 2d8 damage; and so on. As usual, on a hit, add your Illumination modifier to damage, and on a miss, you can spend 1 focus to graze with that attack.',
