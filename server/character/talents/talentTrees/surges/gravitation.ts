Your target can\'t exceed the surge size for your ranks in Gravitation. The infusion uses 1 Investiture each round, and for the duration, the target\'s gravity changes directions. This change uses your gravitation rate, which begins at 25 feet. Your target doesn\'t move fast enough to deal damage on impact. However, if a target is aloft when the surge ends, they fall and take the usual damage from the fall. Targeting a Character: You can target a willing character, granting them a flying rate equal to your gravitation rate for the duration. Alternatively, you can infuse yourself with Gravitation regardless of your size, gaining the same flying rate and spending 1 Investiture each round to maintain the surge. To target an unwilling character, see "Gravitation on Others." Targeting an Object: You can target an object, declaring a new direction for its gravity. At the start of each of your turns, after the infusion expends another 1 Investiture, move that object in a straight line up to your gravitation rate. You can\'t use this surge on Invested objects (like Shardplate) or objects that have been infused with Stormlight (like infused spheres or objects affected by surges).',
