            description: 'You can use this surge to decay a character, object, or area within your reach. You must have a hand free and touch the target. Targeting a Character: You can target a character regardless of their size. Spend 1 Investiture to make a melee Division attack against the Spiritual defense of the target, rolling 3d4 spirit damage. If this reduces the target to 0 health, they crumble into dust and die. The size of this attack\'s damage dice increases with your ranks in Division; at 2 ranks, roll 3d6 (instead of 3d4), and so on. As usual, on a hit, add your Division modifier to damage, and on a miss, you can spend 1 focus to graze with the attack. Targeting an Object or Area: To destroy an object or the contents of an area, spend Investiture equal to the number of surge ranks required to affect a target of that size: 1 for Small, 2 for Medium, and so on. This object or area can\'t exceed the surge size for your ranks in Division. If you\'re in combat or another tense situation, you must succeed on a Division test (see "Division Under Pressure" to determine the DC). On a success (or if you\'re not under pressure), your target decays in a manner of your choosing. For example, you could crumble the object into dust, etch writing or art into the object, destroy parts of an object to form a smaller object, or create a smokescreen that lasts for 1 round in the destroyed object\'s area. You can\'t use this surge on Invested objects (like Shardplate) or objects that have been infused with Stormlight.',
