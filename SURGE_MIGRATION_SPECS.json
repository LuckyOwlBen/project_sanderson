The object can make a melee attack using Tension against the Physical defense of a target within 5 feet of it, rolling 2d4 impact damage. The size of these dice increases with your ranks in Tension; at 2 ranks, roll 2d6 (instead of 2d4), and so on.',\n            actionCost: 2,\n            prerequisites: [\n                { type: 'talent', target: 'tension_cloth_mastery' },\n                { type: 'skill', target: 'TENSION', value: 3 }\n            ],\n            tier: 4,\n            bonuses: [\n                { type: 'health-scaling', target: 'infused object', value: '5 × ranks', scaling: 'with-ranks' },\n                { type: 'defense', target: 'infused object all defenses', value: '10 + modifier', scaling: 'with-modifier' },\n                { type: 'damage-die-scaling', target: 'controlled object attack', value: '2d4', scaling: 'with-ranks', details: '2d4 (rank 1), 2d6 (rank 2), 2d8 (rank 3)' }\n            ],\n            movementEffects: [\n                { type: 'special-movement', amount: 25, movementType: 'move-infused-object', condition: 'while touching infused object', actionCost: 'part-of-action', details: 'Move object along surfaces including ceilings' }\n            ]\n        },"
