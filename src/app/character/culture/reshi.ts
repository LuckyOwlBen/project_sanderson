    description: "The Reshi Isles are a series of misty islands and inhabitable Tai-na greatshell carapaces, each ruled by a monarch. The Tai-na islands roam the Reshi Sea, occasionally colliding in brief conflicts. Reshi people worship these greatshell islands as their gods. Tourism is common on the stationary islands. Most Reshi have brown skin, black hair, and round faces. Unfamiliar with the horrors of devastating wars, they tend to fight fiercely with words but resolve disagreements quickly. The intonation of their language is sharp and spoken in quick bursts, making it difficult for foreigners to learn.",
