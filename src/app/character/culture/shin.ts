    description: "The isolated nation of Shinovar is governed by Stone Shamans who believe that stone is sacred and that it shouldn't be broken or walked on by commoners. A mountain range offers Shinovar significant protection from highstorms, which are already lighter so far west. Non-native crops and animals flourish here, even those that wouldn't survive anywhere else on Roshar. Farmers are highly esteemed, while warriors are seen as lowly and destructive. Those people who commit especially grievous offenses are named Truthless. They must take a symbolic Oathstone and hand it over to a master who claims authority to command them and pass ownership as they please. Shin skin tones vary widely, including pale pink tones that are rarely seen outside Shinovar. Unlike most human ethnic groups on Roshar, their eyes don't have epicanthic folds. Clothing customs assign vibrant colors to people who add to society (such as farmers), and duller colors to people who detract from it.",

Regardless of your religious beliefs, you're familiar with the basic tenets of Stone Shamanism."
