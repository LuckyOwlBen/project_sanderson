    description: "The Horneater Peaks are each ruled by a patriarch called a nuatoma. Atop these steep and inhospitably icy mountains, warm crater lakes form cozy microclimates where crops flourish in balmy humidity. Unkalaki people refer to these lakes as oceans. Traditional family structures dictate each son's occupation according to their birth order; the first two sons are assigned as hunters or farmers, the third as a craftsman, and the fourth as a warrior. Occupations for other genders tend to be more individualized and diverse. Ethnic Unkalaki get their nickname of Horneaters from their abnormally strong teeth that can crush cremling shells, a feature they receive through their ancient singer ancestry. They tend to be tall with red hair, and their skin ranges from pale to tan. A rare few Unkalaki can see spren that most humans can't, earning the title of Sighted. In the Unkalaki tradition, a person's full name is a poem. In less formal situations, they go by a single word or phrase from their name.",
