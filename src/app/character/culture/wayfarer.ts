    description: "Occupation, exile, or tourism may lead a person to live a life of traveling from one place to the next. You could be a traveling surgeon reluctant to return home to Jah Keved, a mercenary from Steen, or an Iriali tidereader sent to gain insights from the shores of faraway lands. Whatever the reason, the lifestyle of a perpetual traveler involves learning land and sea routes between major cities, remaining aware of bandit and pirate risks, and maintaining familiarity with mobile storm shelters, map-reading, and modes of long-distance transportation.",
