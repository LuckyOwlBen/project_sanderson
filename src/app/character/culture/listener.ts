    description: "The listeners are a group of singers who defied Odium long ago and settled near the Shattered Plains. Through oral tradition, they retained their sense of identity during 'the long sleep,' a time when they lost access to nearly all of their forms. When they learned King Gavilar of Alethkar intended to bring back the listener 'gods'—the beings who could take away their agency—the listeners had him assassinated in an effort to retain their autonomy and freedom from Odium's influence. The Alethi, who called the listeners 'Parshendi,' waged the War of Reckoning as vengeance for the death of their king. Narak became the listeners' home, and they slowly recovered more forms to fight the humans. The Song of Listing includes upward of ninety-one forms, but only five were recovered before the Everstorm: dullform, mateform, nimbleform, warform, and workform. Similar to other singers, the listeners are humanoid and typically have red and white or red and black marbled skin, along with red carapace, red or black hair strands, and dark gray eyes.",

    expertise: "The Listener expertise is generally only available to singer characters. If you're a human who has lived or worked closely with the listener people, your GM can give you permission to choose this expertise. As a character with the Listener expertise, you're aware of dullform, mateform, nimbleform, warform and workform (even if you're human and can't assume them yourself), and you're familiar with the listener council known as the Five. Depending on your interests, you might know some of the songs of the listeners. You know basic facts about Shattered Plains ecology. Choose how proficient you are in the listener language and how familiar you are with the rhythms (though any singer instinctively knows all the rhythms). You know about the War of Reckoning and the Alethi armies that fight for gemhearts on the plateaus."
