This infusion uses 1 Investiture each round, and for the duration, the object or surface slides freely. This target can\'t exceed the surge size for your ranks in Abrasion. You can\'t use this surge on other characters, Invested objects (like Shardplate), or objects that have been infused with Stormlight (like infused spheres or objects affected by surges). Alternatively, you can infuse your body with Abrasion, regardless of your size, spending 1 Investiture each round to maintain the surge. While infused, you can freely change which parts of your body are frictionless, and you can use Skate and Slide until the surge ends: Skate (Free Action) - You can skate across the ground as if it were ice. Spend 2 focus to Move (as free action) in a straight line on the ground. You can accomplish this frictionless movement without practice—though you\'ll need experience to do it gracefully! Slide (Passive Ability) - You instinctively remove friction from parts of your body to more easily slide over obstacles or escape bonds. You count as one size smaller when squeezing through spaces, and you gain an advantage on tests to escape restraints that hold you via friction or pressure.',
